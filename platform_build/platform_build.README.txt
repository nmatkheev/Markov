This is DEFAULT folder for building platform

You can make yourself platform, using BuldPlatform.py
But if you download all books of Dariya Dontsova,
building time may be... a lot of excitatory...

You can unzip dantsova and run Stego.py for see, how algorithm work.

We give name dAntsova (not dontsova) for name-disclaimer participle ^_^
You can use another books for building platform, BUT they need be properties:
1) books need have identical style of a statement (one autor is the best resolve)
2) you need VERY BIG count of books 
3) style of a narration has to be sensible, but as much as possible awful!!
